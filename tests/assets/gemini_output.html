    <p>Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in Schedule 1 to that Act.</p>
    <h2>References to ILA s. 39B</h2>
    <p>Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or clause.</p>
    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <p>As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the following effects:</p>
    <ul>• Headings</ul>
    <p>All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act. Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms part of that Act. This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; notes or forms. See section 36(1A)(2A).</p>

    <ul>None</ul>
    <h3>Examples, diagrams or notes</h3>
    <p>All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act. Any examples, diagrams or notes
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act. See section 36(3A).</p>
    <h3>Punctuation</h3>
    <p>All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001
forms part of that Act. Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms
part of that Act. See section 36(3B).</p>

    <h3>Location of "legislative items"</h3>
    <p>A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note. As from 13 October
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative
item that relates to that provision. For example, if a penalty at the foot of a
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be
regarded as being at the foot of that provision. See section 36B.</p>

    <p>Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.
