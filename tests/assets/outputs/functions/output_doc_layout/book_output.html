<p><strong>Schedule 1[5]</strong> amends section 4(1), definition of <em>major offence</em>, to include offences of dangerous<br>
driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm under the <em>Crimes Act 1900</em> as major offences<br>

<p><strong>Schedule 1[47]</strong> replaces Schedule 3, Part 2, Division 4, to make the following changes to the<br>
existing provisions—</p>
<ul class='content-list'>
  <li class='li-level-1'>(a)</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>replace references to accidents with references to crashes,</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>(b)</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>extend the existing power of police officers to arrest an uninjured driver or supervising</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>driver involved in a crash that has resulted in a fatality and take the person to hospital to</li>

  <li class='li-level-1'>supervising drivers involved in a crash that a police officer reasonably suspects has resulted</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>in grievous bodily harm to a person,</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>(c) require blood samples from a crash hospital patient to be taken by an authorised sample</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>taker to ensure consistency in the Act,</li>

  <li class='li-level-1'>driver involved in a crash that has resulted in a fatality and to arrange for the taking of blood</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>and urine samples from the person for alcohol and drug analysis to enable police officers</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>to—</li>
  <li class='li-level-2'>(i) arrest a person riding a bicycle involved in the crash if—</li>
  <li class='li-level-3'>(A) the crash resulted in a fatality, or</li>

  <li class='li-level-3'>harm to a person, and</li>

  <li class='li-level-2'>arrange for the taking of blood and urine samples from the person for alcohol and</li>

  <li class='li-level-1'>(b)</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>extends the power to also apply in relation to bicycle riders.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Schedule 1[66]</strong> replaces the Act, Schedule 3, clause 27(1) and (2). The proposed new subclauses<br>
extend the authority of a laboratory analyst to test a blood or urine sample from a person involved<br>
in a crash for the presence of alcohol or drugs if a police officer has given the laboratory written<br>
notice that the crash resulted in a fatality, to include circumstances where the laboratory has been<br>
given written notice that a police officer reasonably believes a person suffered grievous bodily<br>
harm as a result of the crash within 12 months after the crash. <strong>Schedules 1[68] and [70]</strong> make<br>
consequential amendments.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule 1[89]</strong> inserts transitional provisions to provide that—</p>
<ul class='content-list'>
  <li class='li-level-1'>(a) the amended provisions do not apply in relation to samples taken before the commencement</li>

  <li class='li-level-1'>(b) during a transitional period of 2 years, certificates relating to the conduct of analysis of</li>
  <li class='li-level-1'>samples are not to be considered invalid if the certificate complies with the requirements of</li>
