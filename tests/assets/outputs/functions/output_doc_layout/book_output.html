  <li class='li-level-3'>(A) the crash resulted in a fatality, or</li>
  <li class='li-level-3'>(B) the police officer reasonably suspects the crash has resulted in grievous bodily</li>
  <li class='li-level-3'>harm to a person, and</li>
  <li class='li-level-2'>(ii) arrange for the taking of blood and urine samples from the person for alcohol and</li>
  <li class='li-level-2'>drug analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Schedule 1[54]</strong> amends the Act, Schedule 3, clause 17(5) to omit a redundant definition.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule 1[60]</strong> amends the Act, Schedule 3, clause 18(4) to omit a redundant definition.</p>

extend the authority of a laboratory analyst to test a blood or urine sample from a person involved<br>
in a crash for the presence of alcohol or drugs if a police officer has given the laboratory written<br>
notice that the crash resulted in a fatality, to include circumstances where the laboratory has been<br>
given written notice that a police officer reasonably believes a person suffered grievous bodily<br>
harm as a result of the crash within 12 months after the crash. <strong>Schedules 1[68] and [70]</strong> make<br>
